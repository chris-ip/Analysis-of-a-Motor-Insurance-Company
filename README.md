# Analysis-of-a-Motor-Insurance-Company

I have a dataset giving the details of third party motor insurance claims in Sweden.

By using R tool, I made:

1. descriptive analysis

2. analysis by central tendencies and dispersions measures

3. correlation analysis

4. appropriate test and validation

5. regression models

My report (https://github.com/chris-ip/Analysis-of-a-Motor-Insurance-Company/blob/1af7318902222bd9e5e7b1fb87001b6a31b27c37/Motor%20Insurance%20Co%20Report.pdf)

R file (https://github.com/chris-ip/Analysis-of-a-Motor-Insurance-Company/blob/a95cecfffd34f3b2af1b352ad8c7a54e4f16d726/Motor%20Insurance%20Co.R)

I hope you enjoy my work. Cheers!
