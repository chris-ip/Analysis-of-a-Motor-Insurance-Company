# Analysis-of-a-Motor-Insurance-Company

I have a dataset giving the details of third party motor insurance claims in Sweden.

By using R tool, I made:

1. descriptive analysis

2. analysis by central tendencies and dispersions measures

3. correlation analysis

4. appropriate test and validation

5. regression models

Please find my report Motor Insurance Co Report.pdf above or visit
