# Analysis-of-a-Motor-Insurance-Company

I have a dataset giving the details of third party motor insurance claims in Sweden.

By using R tool, I made:

1. descriptive analysis

2. analysis by central tendencies and dispersions measures

3. correlation analysis

4. appropriate test and validation

5. regression models

Please find my report: Motor Insurance Co Report.pdf above or visit

I hope you enjoy my work. Cheers!
